#Part A: Analysis:

Given the SortedTable class:
```python


class SortedTable:

	# packaging the key-value pair into one object
	class Record:
		def __init__(self, key, value):
			self.key = key
			self.value = value


	def __init__(self, cap=32):

		self.cap = cap


	def insert(self, key, value):

		return True

	def modify(self, key, value):

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.
=> I have been assigned part c, by mutual discussion with my group members. For successful completion of part C which implement hash tables using different collision resolution techniques. I have implemented two classes called LinearProbingTS and LinearProbingNoTS to create hash tables using different collision resolution techniques. In LinearProbingTS, I used chaining with tombstones to handle collisions, while in LinearProbingNoTS, I employed linear probing. These classes allow me to insert, modify, remove, and search key-value pairs in the hash table. I calculated the hash value for each key to determine its position in the table and used the corresponding collision resolution method to place records. To maintain efficiency, I dynamically resized the hash table if the load factor exceeded 0.7. These classes now provide a simple and effective way to store and retrieve data using hash tables while handling collisions effectively.

2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?
=> One thing i learned while doing this code is the implementation of hash tables using different collision resolution techniques.In order to manage key-value pairs efficiently, I learned how to create hash tables using chaining with tombstones (LinearProbingTS) and linear probing (LinearProbingNoTS). My understanding of hash table, data structures, algorithms, and their useful applications in resolving practical issues has improved as a result of this assignment.

3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?
The most challenging aspect of implementing the code was handling collisions.
